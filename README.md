The Programing language based on JavaScript

## Syntax
### Variables
You can assign variables with `<-`
> ```SomeVariable <- "test value"```

## Types
Variables are non-typed, so they can be any types.
Available types are:
* Number (e.g. `123`)
* String (e.g. `"test"`)

## Keywords
`con` - console
`if` - if statement
`exit` - exit the program. Assigning number to it will work as return code.
